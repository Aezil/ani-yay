## Questions
1. What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?

https://github.com/Aezil/ani-yay

2. What API did you use and why?

https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs I used this API because I enjoy anime and games, and wanted to use something I am passionate about!

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.

You can create a user watched/read database where users will choose which anime or manga they have read/watched and marked as read or watched and they can also vote and rank the anime/manga for their list. This can also be made to allow users to monitor upcoming anime and latest news on releases.

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.

I developed the website to be friendly on mobile first and then moved onto desktop. While it said it was fine to use bootstrap I went ahead and wrote up CSS that handles the responsiveness myself. I did however use the table from Bootstrap to quickly get the styling done for the table. I wanted to take the opportunity to show that I can not only use frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material UI, but I can also write my own CSS to handle responsive designs.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?

While I didn't do this in the app, I would have added aria-label to links and buttons and to the table. For color blindness and blindness, I would not rely on colors as much and make things flat and easy to read. Using icons instead or colors to show successes or issues, making the site screen reader friendly, and add the function to change text size on screen.

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?

I would setup paging for the table to make it where we can move across the pages, I would then create a user profile by adding a backend support with a database and start creating a "my anime/manga" list type of site. Cover art is important as this is usually what many go by in finding new anime, so I would add images for the anime. Another feature that the community likes is the ability to share wallpapers and arts. I could create a social gathering section on the sites for these features.
